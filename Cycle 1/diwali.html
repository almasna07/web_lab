	<p>Diwali (English: /dɪˈwɑːliː/; Deepavali,[4] IAST: Dīpāvalī) is the Hindu festival of lights, with variations celebrated in other Indian religions.[a] It symbolises the spiritual "victory of light over darkness, good over evil, and knowledge over ignorance".[5][6][7][8] Diwali is celebrated during the Hindu lunisolar months of Ashvin (according to the amanta tradition) and Kartika—between around mid-September and mid-November.[9][10][11][12] The celebrations generally last five or six days.[13][14]

Diwali is connected to various religious events, deities and personalities, such as being the day Rama returned to his kingdom in Ayodhya with his wife Sita and his brother Lakshmana after defeating the demon king Ravana.[15] It is also widely associated with Lakshmi, the goddess of prosperity, and Ganesha, the god of wisdom and the remover of obstacles.[16] Other regional traditions connect the holiday to Vishnu, Krishna, Durga, Shiva, Kali, Hanuman, Kubera, Yama, Yami, Dhanvantari, or Vishvakarman.

Primarily a Hindu festival, variations of Diwali are also celebrated by adherents of other faiths.[13] The Jains observe their own Diwali which marks the final liberation of Mahavira.[17][18] The Sikhs celebrate Bandi Chhor Divas to mark the release of Guru Hargobind from a Mughal prison.[19] Newar Buddhists, unlike other Buddhists, celebrate Diwali by worshipping Lakshmi, while the Hindus of Eastern India and Bangladesh generally celebrate Diwali by worshipping the goddess Kali.</P>
